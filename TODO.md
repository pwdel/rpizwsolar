## Solar, Power Electronics Tasks

0. Find power supply,  test output of converter circuit to ensure safe for Rpi.
1. Create voltage divider circuit with safety diodes for Rpi ADC measurement unit.
2. Add safety diodes to converter circuit to ensure safety for power out to Rpi off of USB.
3. Create mathematical analog from GPIO measured input to actual voltage measurement.
4. Find lead acid battery appropriate for test.
5. Find solar panel appropriate for test.
6. Calculate approximate needed solar panel and battery size for predicted load.


## Software Tasks

0. Organize pi setup script so that all software programs are installed in order, in the locations that we want,
including setting the proper path variable so that the commands we want to envoke get envoked.
And so that all system commands get started upon startup.

1. Organize Pi configuration so that we have our Pi configured as we want upon Rpilite installation.

2. Create fresh start / delete script.

3. Create python script to read GPIO pins and write to database from Rpi.

4. Create script which deletes all settings from above script in 0. so that when new setup script is run, we get a completely fresh setup.
